so After Messing With Stuff I Was Done With my Own Recovery Switcher But Enough taking go ahead and flash and have fun IF you like my development please follow my project from desktop, by going on the first page of this thread and pressing from the top black corner the button telling you "FOLLOW PROJECT”.
THANK YOU
